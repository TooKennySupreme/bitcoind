Description:
    These scripts will install the bitcoin-qt daemon on your Debian machine.
    The daemon is run under its own user; its data us located in its home directory.

Info:
    An init.d script is installed and is accessible by root-only.
    The daemon should start automatically at start-up.
    Located: /etc/init.d/bitcoind

*** Be sure you're forwarding port 8333 to your node (do this via your router). ***
    To verify, execute:
        ./check_connections.sh



To Install:
    sudo ./install.sh

To Remove:
    sudo ./uninstall.sh

To Check Blockchain Download Status:
    ./blockchain_progress.sh
    Note:
        Specifying the "--poll" flag will make the output update continuously.


Common Problems:
    "When running ./check_connections.sh or ./blockchain_progress.sh, it says it's unable to connect to bitcoind."
        - First: Be sure it's running:
            sudo /etc/init.d/bitcoind status
        - Second: Be sure your bitcoin.conf is created and has the right permissons.
            This is normally done by executing the "NOTICE" text produced at the end of install.sh. If you didn't execute
            that code as the user you're attempting to run ./check_connections.sh or ./blockchain_progress.sh, then you
            must manually copy the daemon's user .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf to your user's /home directory. Be sure to set the
            proper permissions. Keep its content secret.

            Example (Assuming your account name is "user"):
                sudo mkdir /home/user/.bitcoin
                sudo cp /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf /home/user/.bitcoin/.
                sudo chown -R user:user /home/user/.bitcoin
                sudo chmod -R 770 /home/user/.bitcoin
